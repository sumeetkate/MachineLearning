Running the Project : python FinalProject.py trueclass.txt traindata testdata

Note : svmutil library must be installed on machine to run the project.

This project is aimed to develop methods for learning and classifying.

Project is tested on simulated dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data containing 29623 SNPs (total features). Amongst all SNPs are 15 causal ones, which means they and neighboring ones discriminate between case and controls while remainder are noise.

In the training there are 4000 cases and 4000 controls.
